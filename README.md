# CloutContracts Wallet
###### This is the wallets repository for repos related primarily to the ERC20 token for CCS. 

***This is for people who want to run it locally, though its relavance w/ Mist and Metamask existing may not be much. This is in part due to the fact that many of the core dependencies are depreciated, the token pegs, and the fact that most ERC20 or DeFi applications already use metamask. Plus, running these specific programs locally aren't needed for the node and one can always run a wallet through the Geth CLI.***

That said, there are some people who prefer running wallets locally. Some tech savvy users might even implement measures to avoid frontrunning or reduce gas fees all together outside of node transfers.
